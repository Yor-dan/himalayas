          The Himalayas, often referred to as the "Roof of the World," are one of the most awe-inspiring mountain ranges on our planet. This majestic mountain range in Asia, extending over 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) across five countries: India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Pakistan. These mountains are renowned for their colossal height, with numerous peaks soaring well above 20,000 feet (6,000 meters) in elevation. The name "Himalaya" originates from the Sanskrit words "hima," meaning snow, and "alaya," meaning abode, which aptly describes these snow-covered peaks.

The region is divided into three main parallel ranges: the Outer Himalayas (Siwaliks), the Lesser Himalayas (or Middle Himalayas), and the Greater Himalayas (also known as the Inner Himalayas or the High Himalayas).
